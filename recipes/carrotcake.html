    <h1>Brazilian Carrot Cake</h1>
    <div>
        <img src="../img/carrotcake.jpg" alt="Brazilian Carrot Cake" width="400">
        <p>A traditional favorite in my family, Brazilian carrot cake is very different from the American version. The
            popular cake is topped with homemade chocolate frosting, and perfect to serve with a glass of milk or tea.

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 9x13 baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place the carrots, eggs, and oil in a blender or bowl of a food processor. Process until carrots are
                finely chopped. Pour the carrot mixture into a mixing bowl. Stir in 2 cups sugar until well blended.
                Stir in the flour and baking powder; mix until well blended. Pour the batter into the prepared baking
                dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until top springs back when lightly touched, about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the icing by placing the butter, 1 cup sugar, instant hot chocolate drink mix, and milk
                in a pan. While stirring, heat to almost boiling over medium-high heat until mixture thickens. When the
                cake is done, remove from the oven and immediately spread the icing evenly over the top.</li>
        </ol>
